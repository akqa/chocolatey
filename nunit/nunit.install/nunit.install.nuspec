    <summary>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages.</summary>
    <description>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from JUnit, the current production release, version 2.6, is the seventh major release of this xUnit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET. It is written entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET language features, for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.</description>

    <releaseNotes>
NUnit 2.6.4 - Version 2.6.4.14350 - December 16, 2014

General

NUnit 2.6.4 no longer attempts to load tests compiled against NUnit 3.0, which it is unable to run correctly. Previously, the tests appeared to run partially, but either failed silently or gave confusing messages. It's necessary to use a 3.0 runner to run 3.0 tests.
Framework

Async tests are now supported under.NET 4.0
